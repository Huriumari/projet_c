# LogicSimButInC

The project was made for Linux, to simulate logic circuits with the different existing components. 
The software was created entirely with the C language and compiled with gcc-8 with the uses of a MakeFile. The user interface has been built with GTK+ 3 lib.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites needed.

### Installing

Download the folder

Run the installer in your terminal :

```
./install.sh
```

Go get some coffee

Installation has been complete successfully !

You can now run the LogicSimButInC software by opening a terminal and placing yourself in the software's folder and type ./LogicSimButInC to run and begin to use the software.


## Running the tests

You can use key shortcuts to do the same action as the top menu

```
Open : ctrl+o
Save : ctrl+s
Save as : ctrl+shift+s
        ...
```

These shortcuts can be changed by modifying the option file (respect the format of the file option else it won't work)
